## Dice Roller

This is a simple web application that simulates rolling dice based on user input.  
The app generates random dice values and displays the results with corresponding dice images.

### Features

* Input the number of dice to roll.
* Generate random dice values.
* Display corresponding dice images based on the rolled value.
* Simple and responsive design.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure of the webpage.
* **CSS:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For dice roll logic and dynamic rendering.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingGuy001/Dice-Roller.git
cd Dice-Roller
```

2. **Place dice images:**  Ensure you have image files named `1.png` to `6.png` in the `pic/` folder. 
These image files should correspond to the dice values (e.g., `1.png` shows a single dot, `2.png` shows two dots, etc.).

3. **Open the application:** Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

4. **Roll the dice:** Enter the number of dice rolls in the input box and click the **Roll** button to see the results.

### Future Enhancements

* Add animations for dice rolls to make the experience more engaging.
* Support additional dice types like D20 (20-sided die) and D12 (12-sided die) for more versatility.
* Maintain a history of rolls and display statistics to track past rolls and analyze results.
